If you use Arch Linux or any Arch-based Linux (such as Manjaro and Arco), be sure to tackle the Pacman Manager package. pacman is the manager of the Archbase Linux package, which is actually the same apt or dnf in Ubuntu and Fedora, and in general you can use it to manage your own programs.

One of the things you will encounter when comparing Linux is the package manager section, and of course the package manager of each Linux is different (unless they are from the same family) and you in Arch Linux and Manjaro from pacman to install, remove, Update and … you use.

You’ve probably heard of pacman, but not as a closed manager but as a game! And well, it was the creativity of the Arch team to give this name to their package manager.
